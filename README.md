# integer_queue
Implementation of the queue data structure for integer data types.

The algorithm works as follows: 

- Prompt the user to push, pop, or view items in the queue
- To keep track of the front and rear of the queue, two integer indicators are used
- Detect and accommodate both “empty” and “full” states.
